# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?

I did Codecademy's HTML tutorial and took an HTML class at community college, but my front end knowledge is fairly low.


## How difficult was this assignment?

It was not difficult, I tried to type out the text and I ended up typing something wrong.
Once I copy/pasted, things were fine.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

I learned about anonymous functions. I am curious what a function with a name would look like. I also learned about
the developer tools in Chrome, although I couldn't find where it showed the status of my button.


## How could this assignment be improved?

I misread the head and header as different things. You did say in the header comment that I would put my links to my CSS and JS there.
I was confused for a moment and thought I had to create a head tag, instead of inserting everything into my header.  


## Any other comments?

I think we could have done a bit more, even if this was a first assignment. As for what?

Perhaps try to insert an image or create a link to another page.

Of course, this is without knowing what our future assignments are (as you mentioned, they will get more exciting!).
